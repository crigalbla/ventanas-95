# Ventanas 95

Welcome to Ventanas 95, a nostalgic trip to the iconic operating system from 1995 recreated with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). This project aims to provide a fun and interactive experience reminiscent of said interface. You can use it in mobile, but you will have to put your MOBILE IN HORIZONTAL.

## Features

- **Familiar interface:**
> Relive the classic Ventanas 95 desktop experience in a 1995-looking interface. Short wait times have been simulated with some interactions.
- **Login interface:**
> You can log in with a user or as a guest if you wish. Once inside, you can simulate logging out, suspending, restarting, and shutting down the operating system. Remember that when you suspend or turn off the computer, after 2 seconds, you must click or press a key to see the interface again
- **Interactive Windows:**
> Explore the desktop, open folders and interact with the different windows on the screen. You can move them, enlarge them and reduce them.
- **Interactive DesktopIcons:**
> The desktopIcons have a lot of play. You can create, edit, move, copy, cut and paste them. You will be able to do all this functionality between folders. If you delete an icon, it will go directly to the recycling bin.
- **Notepad:**
> There is a notepad type of desktopIcon, where you can create text and save it if you want.
- **DesktopIcons selection:**
> You can select several desktopIcons at the same time, although at the moment you cannot do anything with all of them at the same time.
- **Translations:**
> This project has Spanish and English languages, so all the texts generated at the beginning can be translated when the language is changed
